# Trie Data Structure Implementation in C++

## Overview
This project implements a Trie data structure in C++ for efficient string storage and retrieval, especially useful for prefix-based searches. Tries are tree-like data structures, commonly used in applications like autocomplete and spell check.

## Features
- **Insert Words**: Efficiently adds words to the Trie.
- **Search Words**: Checks if a word exists in the Trie.
- **Prefix Search**: Finds all words with a given prefix, making it ideal for autocomplete functionalities.

## File Structure
- **Trie.cpp**: Contains the main implementation code for the Trie data structure, including `insert`, `search`, and `words_with_prefix` methods.

## How to Run
1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Compile the C++ file with a command like:
   ```bash
   g++ Trie.cpp -o Trie
